Declarative programming is old fashion task, where you write big block of code to accomplish the task
such as to calculate the total count of certain variable in List you run the for loop such as, Also in 
declarative programming the side-effects are that it modify the parameter values in some situation.

List<Student> lists=....
For(Student std: students)
    count +=std.grade;

Functional programming is that you want to achieve the result without modifying the existing value of certain parameter,
this is the beauty of function programming where the data comes as value and then perform some task and return the 
value back to caller. Such as Math.pow(x,y), this is power function take two arguments, and return the value of x power y, without modifying any values.
